== Preamble

A DQMH module is the main component of an architecture based on DQMH(R) framework. A DQMH module is used to implement a section of the application that has one responsibility.

DQMH(R) framework defines two different type of DQMH module.  

====
*Singleton:*

A Singleton DQMH module can have only one instance running at any given time.
====

====
*Cloneable:*

A Cloneable DQMH module can have one or multiple instances running in parallel.
====

DQMH(R) framework defines two different ways to carry data throughout the application and with both other DQMH modules and non-DQMH based code.

====
*Request events:*

A request is a code that fires an event requesting the DQMH module to do something. Multiple locations in the code can send events to the DQMH module.

Request events are many-to-one.

Requests are usually named using imperative tense.
====

====
*Broadcast events:*

A broadcast is a code that fires an event broadcasting that the DQMH module did something. Multiple Event Structures can register to handle the Broadcast Events.

Broadcast Events are one-to-many.

Broadcasts are usually named using past tense or passive voice.
====

NOTE: Refer to the DQMH(R) framework official http://delacor.com/documentation/dqmh-html/[documentation] to find more details on how the framework works


The following section gives you details on the project architecture relying on this framework.
It gives you an overview of the modules' interaction and detailed information on each module.

Graphs used in this section have the following legend:

[NOTE]
====
One arrow can represent one or more events between two components
====

[NOTE]
====
Request and Request and wait for Reply are represented by only one arrow.
If there is no Request and wait for Reply, Request representation is used.
Otherwise Request and wait for Reply is used
